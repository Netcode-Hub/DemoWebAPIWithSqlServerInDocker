# Simplify Your Workflow: End of Manual Configs! üéâ Run .NET Web API with SQL Server in Docker üê≥‚ú®
# Introduction
 We‚Äôre taking it up a notch by connecting our Web API to SQL Server and running everything as a Docker image! üöÄ Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this tutorial is packed with valuable insights to streamline your development process. Let's dive in 
 and see why this setup is a game-changer for modern web development! üåê

# Scenario
Imagine you‚Äôre working on a complex application that requires a robust database solution. SQLite is great for lightweight applications and development, but as your application grows, you‚Äôll need a more powerful database like SQL Server. Running SQL Server and your Web API in Docker containers allows you to create a consistent and isolated environment, making development, testing, and deployment smoother and more efficient. Plus, it simplifies the setup process across different machines and environments. üìà

# Do you Know What Docker Is?
Imagine you're a developer working on a complex web application. Your application needs to run on multiple developer machines, each with slightly different configurations. You might be using Windows, while your colleague uses macOS, and another team member uses Linux. Setting up the same development environment on each machine can be a nightmare. You need to ensure that every machine has the correct versions of .NET, SQL Server, and other dependencies. Even small differences in configurations can lead to the dreaded "it works on my machine" problem.
This is where Docker comes to the rescue! Docker allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a container, which is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package. Containers ensure that your application runs consistently across different environments.
When a new developer joins the project, they can get started by simply running a couple of Docker commands, which will set up the entire environment for them. No more lengthy setup instructions or troubleshooting environment-specific issues!
By using Docker, you streamline your development process, reduce setup time, and ensure consistency across different stages of development and deployment. It‚Äôs a powerful tool that simplifies complex tasks and makes your development workflow much more efficient.

# What To Cover
In this tutorial, we'll cover:
1. Setting up the Docker environment üê≥
2. We'll pull the SQL Server image from Docker Hub and configure it to run alongside our .NET Web API.
3. Configuring the Web API üõ†Ô∏è
4. You'll learn how to modify your connection strings and set up the necessary configurations to connect your Web API to the SQL Server database.
5. Creating and running Docker containers üöÄ
6. We‚Äôll guide you through building Docker images for both your Web API and SQL Server, and then running them as containers.
7. Testing the setup ‚úÖ
8. Finally, we'll test the setup to ensure that your Web API can communicate with the SQL Server database seamlessly.

# Lets Start By Creating Connection String

        "LogLevel": {
